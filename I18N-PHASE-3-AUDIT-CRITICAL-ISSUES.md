1. **CampaignLauncher.tsx** - 30+ hardcoded strings
2. **AdManager.tsx** - Status labels
3. Complete audit of all 34 Command Center components

### Next Steps

3. Audit and fix all command-center components
4. Re-test entire demo in all 3 languages

## 🔥 User's Concern is VALID

> "ik zie nog steeds nederlands en engelse taal door elkaar bij sommige onderdelen"

**Analysis**:

- User is absolutely correct
- While we fixed 69+ hardcoded strings in Phase 1B
- We missed ENTIRE COMPONENTS that have useTranslation but don't use it
- CampaignLauncher alone has 30+ untranslated strings
- Likely 50-100+ more hardcoded strings across dashboard and command-center

**Root Cause**:

- Components were created with useTranslation hook
- But all UI text remained hardcoded
- These weren't caught by our string search patterns
- They're hidden inside components that "look" internationalized

---

**RECOMMENDATION**:
Systematic component-by-component audit and fix, starting with most visible UI components (Dashboard, Command Center, Explorer modals).
