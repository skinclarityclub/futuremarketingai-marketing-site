# 🎯 Team Size Positioning - Alternative Strategy 2025

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Research Source:** Perplexity AI + Project Documentation Analysis  
**Status:** Recommendation → Review  
**Goal:** Replace repetitive "10-50 teams" with flexible, outcome-based positioning

---

## 🚨 **CURRENT PROBLEM**

**Issue:** "Teams 10-50" appears **69 times** across the codebase
- Hero sections: 15+ occurrences
- Trust signals: 8+ occurrences
- Subtitles: 12+ occurrences
- CTAs and explorer pages: 20+ occurrences

**User Concern (Daley):** *"Ik twijfel nog een beetje over het feit dat we op zoveel plekken teams 10-50 vermelden"*

**Why This Is Right to Question:**
1. ❌ **Too Restrictive:** 9-person or 55-person teams may self-disqualify
2. ❌ **Arbitrary:** Size doesn't equal fit (20-person fintech ≠ 20-person non-profit budget)
3. ❌ **Repetitive:** Loses impact when mentioned everywhere
4. ❌ **Industry Standard:** Leading SaaS companies avoid this

## 📊 **PERPLEXITY RESEARCH INSIGHTS**

### **What Top SaaS Companies Do:**

| Company      | Public Messaging                          | Backend Targeting                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Slack**    | "For teams of all sizes"                  | Segments by size in sales         |
| **HubSpot**  | "Small business / Enterprise" (broad)     | Size filters in pricing           |
| **Salesforce**| Industry + function focus                | Size as secondary filter          |

### **Key Finding:**
> "Use **outcome- and role-based positioning** in public-facing copy. Reserve specific size targeting for **paid ads**, **sales qualification**, and **pricing pages**."

---

## ✅ **RECOMMENDED ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY**

### **1. Hero Sections → Outcome-Based**

**BEFORE:**
```
"Autonomous Marketing for Teams 10-50"
"For teams of 10-50 people. AI that creates content 24/7..."
```

**AFTER:**
```
"Autonomous Marketing That Scales"
"For fast-moving teams ready to 10x output without adding headcount"
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ Outcome-focused ("10x output")
- ✅ Stage-focused ("fast-moving teams")
- ✅ Inclusive (doesn't exclude 8 or 60-person teams)
- ✅ Aspirational ("ready to scale")

---

### **2. Trust Signals → Problem-Based**

**BEFORE:**
```
🏆 Teams 10-50  💰 Founders Pricing  🔬 GPT-4
```

**AFTER (Option A - Problem Focus):**
```
🚀 Built FOR Scale  💰 Founders Pricing  🔬 GPT-4 & Claude
```

**AFTER (Option B - Stage Focus):**
```
⚡ Growth-Stage Teams  💰 Founders Pricing  🔬 GPT-4 & Claude
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ Self-selection based on stage/need, not arbitrary number
- ✅ "Built FOR scale" reinforces custom-built USP from MAATWERK doc
- ✅ More premium positioning

---

### **3. Subtitles → Role + Challenge-Based**

**BEFORE:**
```
"Perfect for teams of 10-50 people"
```

**AFTER (Option A - Role-Based):**
```
"Perfect for marketing leaders overwhelmed by channel growth"
```

**AFTER (Option B - Challenge-Based):**
```
"Perfect for scaling teams managing 5+ marketing channels"
```

**AFTER (Option C - Hybrid):**
```
"Built for mid-market teams ready to scale content production"
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ Speaks to pain point (overwhelmed, scaling challenges)
- ✅ Uses proxy indicator ("5+ channels" from proxy doc)
- ✅ Self-qualifying (if you're not overwhelmed, not your problem)

---

### **4. Feature Pages → Use Case-Based**

**BEFORE:**
```
"Perfect for teams of 10-50 who need strategic insights without hiring researchers."
```

**AFTER:**
```
"Perfect for lean teams who need strategic insights without hiring a research team."
```

**Why Better:**
- ✅ "Lean teams" = flexible (could be 5 or 50)
- ✅ Focus on constraint (budget/headcount) not size
- ✅ More relatable

---

## 🎯 **WHERE TO KEEP SIZE MENTIONS (Strategic)**

### **Keep Specific Size In:**

1. ✅ **Paid Ads (LinkedIn, Google):**
   - "For marketing teams of 10-50"
   - Why: Platform targeting filters by size anyway

2. ✅ **Pricing Page (Contextual):**
   - "Scales with your team from 10 to 100+"
   - Why: Helps set pricing expectations

3. ✅ **Case Studies:**
   - "How Acme (25 employees) achieved 10x output"
   - Why: Provides relatable social proof

4. ✅ **Sales Qualification:**
   - Internal CRM field: "Target Team Size: 10-50"
   - Why: Backend filtering, not customer-facing

```

## 📊 **EXPECTED BENEFITS**

### **Before (Current):**
- 69 mentions of "10-50" across codebase
- Restrictive positioning
- Risk of self-disqualification

### **After (Proposed):**
- ~15 strategic mentions (ads, case studies, pricing)
- Inclusive, aspirational positioning
- Focus on outcomes and pain points
- Aligned with industry best practices

### **Proxy Indicators Still Working:**
Per `proxy-indicators-framework.md`, we can use:
- ✅ "Managing 5+ marketing channels" (behavior proxy)
- ✅ "Team of 3 doing work of 30" (outcome proxy)
- ✅ "Creating 5 posts/week, need 50?" (volume proxy)
- ✅ "Lean teams" / "Scaling teams" (stage proxy)

These naturally attract 10-50 person companies without excluding edge cases.
