## Recommendations for Your Project

Given your need for advanced AI-driven market research, multi-platform orchestration, and real-time optimization, **HubSpot Marketing Hub Enterprise** is the closest all-in-one fit, but at a premium price. For a modular approach, combine **Semrush Business** (for research) with **Hootsuite Enterprise** or **Sprout Social Advanced** (for orchestration and publishing), though this increases integration complexity.

**Actionable Steps:**

- **Request custom quotes** from vendors based on your team size, usage, and required AI features.
- **Clarify AI assistant capabilities**—most tools’ “AI assistants” are not yet at the level of a Perplexity AI + analyst team.
- **Budget for integration and onboarding** if combining multiple platforms.
- **Test AI content and analytics features** for your specific use cases before committing to annual contracts.
