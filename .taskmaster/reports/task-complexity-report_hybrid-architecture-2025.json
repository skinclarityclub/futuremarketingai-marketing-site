      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) create Next.js project with TypeScript, (2) configure ESLint and Prettier, (3) set up strict TypeScript mode, (4) initialize and push to GitHub.",
      "reasoning": "This is a foundational task with clear, sequential steps. Each step is well-defined and low-risk, but automating and documenting each ensures reproducibility and reduces setup errors. The complexity is moderate due to the number of tools involved, but each subtask is straightforward."
