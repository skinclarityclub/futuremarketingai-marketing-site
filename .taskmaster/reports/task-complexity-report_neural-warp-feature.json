      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Project Setup and Component Scaffolding",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down project setup into: (1) initializing repository and dev environment (Vite/Next.js), (2) installing and configuring dependencies, (3) scaffolding required components/hooks/utilities/types, (4) setting up ESLint, Prettier, Husky, (5) verifying TypeScript strict typing and basic test suite.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard project initialization and scaffolding, which is well-documented and supported by modern tooling. While there are multiple dependencies and configuration steps, each is straightforward and follows established patterns for React/TypeScript projects[2][4][5]. The main complexity arises from ensuring all files are correctly structured and strictly typed, but no advanced logic or integration is required at this stage."

      "taskTitle": "Reusable Asset Import and Helper Utilities",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) exporting neural node and particle data from Hero, (2) implementing each math helper function, (3) ensuring pure/unit-testable helpers, (4) writing comprehensive unit tests for all helpers.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing reusable utilities and math helpers requires careful attention to correctness, purity, and testability. While the functions themselves are not highly complex, edge case handling and strict typing add moderate complexity. Ensuring helpers are pure and unit-testable aligns with best practices and increases reliability[4][6]."

      "taskTitle": "Canvas Renderer: NeuralWarpCanvas Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) setting up Canvas 2D context and rendering pipeline, (2) implementing batch rendering and offscreen blur, (3) supporting all animation phases, (4) adaptive quality logic, (5) devicePixelRatio and fallback handling, (6) writing unit/integration/visual regression tests.",
      "reasoning": "High-performance canvas rendering with adaptive quality, multiple animation phases, and device-specific optimizations is technically challenging. It requires deep understanding of the Canvas API, performance profiling, and robust fallback strategies. Testing rendering logic and visual output adds further complexity."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) designing state machine for animation phases, (2) implementing timing and transitions with useReducer/useRef, (3) supporting callbacks and error handling, (4) cleanup and error boundary integration, (5) testing phase transitions and integration with NeuralWarpCanvas.",
      "reasoning": "Managing complex animation state, timing, and transitions in a custom hook requires careful design to avoid bugs and ensure reliability. Supporting callbacks, cleanup, and error boundaries increases the technical challenge, especially when integrating with rendering and accessibility requirements."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide into: (1) implementing device and connection detection logic, (2) adaptive quality presets and real-time FPS monitoring, (3) prefers-reduced-motion and saveData handling, (4) fallback logic and testing under simulated conditions.",
      "reasoning": "Detecting device capabilities and adapting animation fidelity involves integrating multiple browser APIs and handling real-time performance metrics. While not algorithmically complex, ensuring reliability across devices and conditions requires thorough testing and robust logic."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) replacing anchor navigation with animation triggers, (2) handling navigation post-animation, (3) preloading on hover and code splitting, (4) skip logic and repeat visitor handling.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating the transition into navigation flows and demo entry points is a common pattern, but requires careful handling of user experience, code splitting, and skip logic. Complexity is moderate due to the need for robust integration and testing across entry points."
