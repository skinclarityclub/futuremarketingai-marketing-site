      "taskTitle": "Initialize Project Repository and Tooling",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup into: (1) Create Git repository, (2) Scaffold Vite + React + TypeScript, (3) Install and configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme, (4) Add and configure Prettier, (5) Add and configure ESLint, (6) Ensure Node.js 20+ compatibility and document setup steps.",
      "reasoning": "This task is foundational but follows well-documented, standard patterns. Each tool (Vite, Tailwind, Prettier, ESLint) requires separate configuration and verification, and custom theming adds moderate complexity. Industry best practice is to modularize setup for maintainability and onboarding."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Connect repository to Vercel, (2) Configure staging and production environments with environment variables, (3) Set up Cloudflare CDN for static assets, (4) Enable automatic deployments on main branch push, (5) Document deployment and rollback procedures.",
      "reasoning": "Deployment configuration involves multiple external services and environment management. Each integration (Vercel, Cloudflare, env vars) is a discrete step with its own risks and verification needs. Best practice is to isolate and document each for reliability and reproducibility."

      "reasoning": "A global design system impacts all UI and requires careful planning, configuration, and testing. Custom effects and typography integration increase complexity. Storybook integration is a best practice for visual regression and documentation."

      "reasoning": "Routing is a core architectural concern. Adding breadcrumbs and progress indicators introduces cross-cutting concerns. Each feature is best handled as a subtask for clarity and testability."

      "reasoning": "Dynamic forms with real-time previews and animations are moderately complex, requiring state management, validation, and UI feedback. Each input type and animation should be isolated for maintainability and test coverage."

      "reasoning": "Multiple complex visualizations, each with unique data and animation requirements, increase cognitive and technical complexity. Export features and interactivity add further integration points. Best practice is to modularize each visualization."

      "reasoning": "Accessibility compliance is a cross-cutting concern requiring code review, refactoring, and manual/automated testing. Each aspect (labels, focus, semantics, testing) is a distinct area per WCAG 2.1 AA standards."
