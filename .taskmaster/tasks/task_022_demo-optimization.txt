# Task ID: 22
# Title: Video Testimonials - Authentic Social Proof
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Replace customer testimonial videos with founder authority content. Instead of 2-3 client video testimonials, produce 2-3 short founder vision videos (45-90s each) that demonstrate technical credibility, explain the product vision, and show the real system in action. Goal: increase trust and conversion by 10-15% through authentic, transparent founder-led content.
# Details:
**Problem Identified (Audit)**
No customer testimonials are available (only 2 companies, both founder's own). Text testimonials lack emotional impact, and fake testimonials would undermine trust. Early-stage buyers value authenticity and technical authority.

**Solution: Founder Vision Video System**

## 1. Founder Explanation Videos (Technical Authority)

**Produce 2-3 founder videos:**
- **Video 1: "How Autonomous Marketing Actually Works" (60s)**
  - Script: Founder introduces self, explains the multi-agent AI system, shows real screen recording, shares personal results (e.g., 360 hours/month saved), and invites viewers to book a call.
- **Video 2: "Why I Built This (The Vision)" (45s)**
  - Script: Founder shares the market context, the inflection point with autonomous AI, and the opportunity for early adopters.
- **Video 3: "Live System Walkthrough" (90s)**
  - Script: Screen recording of the actual dashboard, showing content calendar, analytics, and campaign manager, with a call to action.

**Alternative:** If not comfortable on camera, use animated text overlays and screen recordings with founder voiceover.

## 2. Component Structure

- Replace `VideoTestimonialSection` with `FounderVideoSection`.
- Use a grid layout to display all founder videos with thumbnails, titles, durations, and play tracking.
- Add a clear badge and subtitle explaining the absence of customer testimonials and emphasizing transparency.
- CTA below videos: "Book a Founder Call".

**Example JSX:**
```tsx
<FounderVideoSection className="py-16">
  <Header>
    <Badge>ðŸŽ¥ From the Founder</Badge>
    <Title>See How It Actually Works</Title>
    <Subtitle>
      No customer testimonials yet (we're that new).
      <br />
      Instead, here's me showing you the actual technology.
    </Subtitle>
  </Header>
  <VideoGrid className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8">
    <FounderVideo ... />
    ...
  </VideoGrid>
  <CTABelow className="mt-12 text-center">
    <Text className="text-lg text-white/90 mb-6">
      Ready to see it running for your business?
    </Text>
    <Button size="lg" variant="primary" glow onClick={openCalendly}>
      Book a Founder Call â†’
    </Button>
  </CTABelow>
</FounderVideoSection>
```

## 3. Production Approach

- **DIY:** Record with iPhone/webcam (1080p+), Loom for screen, CapCut/DaVinci for editing, Descript for subtitles. 4-6 hours, minimal cost.
- **Semi-Pro:** Hire video editor for color grading, motion graphics, and pro subtitles. â‚¬200-500, 3-5 days turnaround.

## 4. Implementation Files

- Update: `src/components/testimonials/VideoTestimonial.tsx` â†’ `FounderVideo.tsx`
- Update: `src/components/testimonials/VideoTestimonialSection.tsx` â†’ `FounderVideoSection.tsx`
- Remove: Customer testimonial data files and fake testimonials
- Add: `/public/videos/` (founder video files), `/docs/video-scripts.md` (scripts)

## 5. Expected Impact
+10-15% trust and conversion (authentic founder content is more credible than fake testimonials at this stage)

## 6. Time Estimate
- Component update: 2-3 hours
- Video production (DIY): 4-6 hours
- Total: 6-9 hours

## 7. Priority
MEDIUM - Founder authority is credible for early-stage

# Test Strategy:
**Testing Strategy:**

1. **Video Playback:**
   - Test on Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge
   - Test on iOS Safari, Android Chrome
   - Test MP4 + WebM fallback
   - Verify autoplay policies respected
   - Verify playsinline works on mobile

2. **Accessibility:**
   - Subtitles display correctly (auto-generated or manual)
   - Keyboard controls (space, arrows)
   - Screen reader announces video presence
   - Transcript available (optional)

3. **Performance:**
   - Videos lazy load below fold
   - Thumbnail loads first (LQIP)
   - No layout shift when loading
   - Max 2MB per video (60-90s)
   - Buffering indicator shows

4. **Analytics Validation:**
   - Track video play, pause, completion, and CTA clicks ("Book a Founder Call")
   - Example events:
     ```typescript
     'founder_video_play' // When video starts
     'founder_video_pause' // When paused
     'founder_video_25' // 25% watched
     'founder_video_50' // 50% watched
     'founder_video_75' // 75% watched
     'founder_video_complete' // Finished watching
     'founder_video_cta_click' // CTA clicked after video
     ```

5. **User Testing:**
   - Do founder videos increase trust?
   - Is the technical explanation clear?
   - Does it influence booking decision?
   - Target: 70% say "videos helped"

6. **A/B Test:**
   - Control: No video or text only
   - Treatment: Founder videos
   - Measure: Trust score, CTA clicks, time on page

7. **Bandwidth Fallback:**
   - Slow 3G: Shows thumbnail + text overlay
   - User can opt-in to play video
   - No automatic video load on mobile data
