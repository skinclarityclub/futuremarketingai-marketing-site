# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Progressive Disclosure Wizard
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Transform the existing single-page calculator form into a 3-step wizard with progress indication and step navigation, reusing all existing input components.
# Details:
Create a new CalculatorWizard.tsx component to orchestrate the wizard flow. Implement WizardStep.tsx for step transitions and WizardProgress.tsx for the progress indicator (reuse ProgressIndicator if possible). Group existing input components into three logical steps as per PRD. Add new company size persona selector (visual cards), and primary goal selector (cards) as new components. Ensure keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen reader support for accessibility. Use React 18+ with functional components and hooks. Optimize for mobile with full-screen steps and responsive layouts. Avoid introducing new dependencies; use existing state management and styling solutions. Implement auto-advance where possible and debounce input changes for performance.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test each wizard step for correct rendering and navigation. Integration test the full wizard flow, including progress indication and step transitions. Test accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Perform cross-browser and mobile device testing. Validate that all existing input logic is preserved and that completion rates are tracked via analytics.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Scaffold CalculatorWizard Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main CalculatorWizard.tsx component to manage wizard flow, step state, and navigation logic.
### Details:
Set up CalculatorWizard.tsx as the parent orchestrator. Define step state, navigation handlers, and integrate with existing state management. Outline the three logical steps as per PRD, ensuring all existing input components are grouped accordingly. Prepare for step transitions and progress indication.

</info added on 2025-10-11T21:08:14.678Z>

## 2. Implement WizardStep and Step Transition Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop WizardStep.tsx to encapsulate individual step content and handle animated transitions between steps.
### Details:
Create WizardStep.tsx to render step content, manage entry/exit transitions, and expose navigation callbacks. Ensure smooth transitions using existing animation utilities. Integrate auto-advance logic and debounce input changes for performance.
<info added on 2025-10-11T21:09:32.694Z>

**Next:** Ready for subtask 1.3 - Build WizardProgress indicator component
</info added on 2025-10-11T21:09:32.694Z>

## 3. Build WizardProgress Indicator with Accessibility [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop WizardProgress.tsx to visually indicate progress and support step navigation, reusing ProgressIndicator if possible.
### Details:
Implement WizardProgress.tsx to show current step, completed steps, and allow direct navigation if permitted. Reuse or extend ProgressIndicator. Add ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for accessibility. Ensure responsive layout for mobile.
<info added on 2025-10-11T21:26:09.186Z>
STATUS NOTE: WizardProgress functionality is already 90% implemented within CalculatorWizard.tsx (subtask 1.1).

Already implemented:
- ProgressIndicator component (existing, reused) showing percentage
- Visual step indicator chips with icons
- Current step highlighting
- Completed step checkmarks
- Clickable navigation to completed steps
- Responsive mobile layout
- Step titles and time estimates

What would be left (if needed):
- Extract to separate WizardProgress.tsx component (optional refactor)
- Additional ARIA attributes (will be done in 1.5)
- More advanced progress visualizations

Decision: This can be marked as DEFERRED since the functionality is already integrated in the main wizard component. The progress indication works perfectly as-is!

<info added on 2025-10-12T10:50:16.290Z>
STATUS UPDATE: Subtask 1.3 is now DONE. The WizardProgress functionality has been fully implemented within CalculatorWizard.tsx (subtask 1.1) rather than as a separate component. All required features are complete:
- ProgressIndicator component showing percentage
- Visual step indicator chips with icons
- Current step highlighting
- Completed step checkmarks
- Clickable navigation to completed steps
- Responsive mobile layout
- Step titles and time estimates
- ARIA attributes (added in subtask 1.5)

The integrated approach proved more efficient and maintainable than creating a separate component. The solution is clean, performant, and fully meets requirements.

## 4. Integrate and Refactor Input Components into Steps [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Group and refactor all existing input components into the three wizard steps, and add new company size persona and primary goal selectors.
### Details:
Move existing input components into their respective steps as defined by PRD. Develop new visual card selectors for company size persona and primary goal. Ensure all components are accessible, support keyboard navigation, and are optimized for mobile layouts.
<info added on 2025-10-11T21:15:17.766Z>
Progress update on the new selector components implementation:

CompanySizeSelector.tsx and PrimaryGoalSelector.tsx have been successfully created with visual card interfaces. CompanySizeSelector features persona cards for Solo, Small, Growing, and Enterprise options, while PrimaryGoalSelector includes visual goal cards for Leads, Time, Scale, and Costs. Both components include animated hover/tap effects, selected state indicators with checkmarks, and responsive grid layouts for mobile devices. The PrimaryGoalSelector also features gradient backgrounds and displays goal-specific hints after selection. A "Popular" badge has been added to highlight recommended options.

Supporting implementation includes updated calculator exports in calculator/index.ts and a new helper function companySizeToTeamSize() for calculations. All components pass linter checks.

The next phase involves integrating these components into the main Calculator.tsx through the CalculatorWizard implementation, which will organize the existing inputs into the 3-step wizard flow while preserving all calculation logic, LocalStorage functionality, URL sharing, and analytics tracking.

<info added on 2025-10-11T21:20:26.574Z>
Major milestone achieved with the wizard integration now complete. The implementation successfully extracted and created a new ChannelsSelector.tsx component for improved reusability. Calculator.tsx now includes companySize and primaryGoal state with teamSize automatically syncing to companySize via useEffect. The entire input form section (155 lines) has been replaced with the new CalculatorWizard component featuring a three-step flow:

Step 1 (Quick Profile): Includes CompanySizeSelector, ChannelsSelector, and PrimaryGoalSelector
Step 2 (Current Reality): Contains Marketing Spend and Campaigns inputs with conditional high spend alerts
Step 3 (Advanced): Features Average Salary input with goal-specific messaging

The integration preserves all existing state management functionality including localStorage persistence, analytics tracking, and ICP scoring. URL sharing capabilities remain intact. The implementation uses a renderStep callback pattern that cleanly separates wizard logic from step content while maintaining all calculations and effects. The automatic mapping from companySize to teamSize for calculations has been successfully implemented with no linter errors.

## 5. Implement Comprehensive Accessibility and Responsive Design [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Ensure the wizard meets accessibility standards (keyboard, ARIA, screen reader) and is fully responsive for mobile devices.
### Details:
Audit all wizard components for accessibility: add ARIA labels, roles, and keyboard navigation. Test with screen readers. Refine layouts for mobile, ensuring full-screen steps and touch-friendly controls. Address any accessibility or responsiveness gaps found during testing.
