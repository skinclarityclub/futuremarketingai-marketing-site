# Task ID: 1
# Title: Establish Project Foundation and Tech Stack
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the project repository, configure core dependencies, and establish the technical baseline for the demo transformation.
# Details:
Initialize a monorepo using pnpm or Yarn Workspaces for modularity. Use Next.js 14+ (React 18+) for SSR and routing, Tailwind CSS 3.x for styling, Framer Motion for animation, Zustand for state management, and TypeScript for type safety. Integrate Prettier, ESLint (airbnb config), and Husky for code quality. Ensure Vite or Turbopack for fast builds. Configure environment variables for API keys and analytics. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify repository setup, linting, formatting, and successful local build/start. Confirm all dependencies are installed and project structure matches requirements.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Monorepo and Project Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the monorepo using pnpm or Yarn Workspaces, create the base folder structure, and add initial Next.js applications and shared packages.
### Details:
Create the root repository, configure pnpm or Yarn workspaces, and organize the directory structure with 'apps' and 'packages' folders. Scaffold at least one Next.js 14+ app and a shared package for reusable code.

## 2. Configure Core Dependencies and Tooling [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install and configure essential dependencies including Next.js 14+, React 18+, Tailwind CSS 3.x, Framer Motion, Zustand, and TypeScript across the monorepo.
### Details:
Add and configure each dependency in the relevant packages. Set up Tailwind CSS with PostCSS, configure Framer Motion for animation, Zustand for state management, and ensure TypeScript is enabled and properly configured in all apps and packages.

## 3. Set Up Code Quality and Formatting Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Integrate Prettier, ESLint (with Airbnb config), and Husky for consistent code style and pre-commit checks.
### Details:
Install Prettier and ESLint in the root, extend Airbnb config, and create shared lint/format scripts. Set up Husky to run lint and format checks on pre-commit. Add configuration files (.prettierrc, .eslintrc, .husky) at the root and ensure all packages inherit these settings.

## 4. Configure Build Tools and Environment Variables [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Set up Vite or Turbopack for fast builds and configure environment variable management for API keys and analytics.
### Details:
Integrate Vite or Turbopack as the build tool for Next.js apps. Establish .env files and environment variable loading for all packages, ensuring secure handling of sensitive data. Document required environment variables.

## 5. Implement CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Set up continuous integration and deployment workflows using GitHub Actions for automated testing, linting, and deployment.
### Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflows to install dependencies, run lint and format checks, build the project, and deploy to the target environment. Ensure workflows are modular and reusable for all packages/apps.
