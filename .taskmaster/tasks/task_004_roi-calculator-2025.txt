# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Interactive Scenario Explorer
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable users to explore 'what if' scenarios with interactive sliders, updating ROI metrics in real-time to increase engagement and understanding.
# Details:
Create ScenarioExplorer.tsx with InteractiveSlider components styled from InputSlider. Allow users to adjust key variables (e.g., campaigns, platforms) and see immediate ROI impact using calculateROIMetrics. Use local state for scenario inputs and a calculateScenarioROI() wrapper for recalculations. Optimize with useMemo for performance. Place Scenario Explorer after results, before CTA, as per PRD. Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessible slider controls.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test scenario calculations and slider interactions. Integration test for correct ROI updates and UI feedback. Validate placement in the flow and responsiveness. Test accessibility of sliders and live updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ScenarioExplorer.tsx component with interactive sliders [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the main ScenarioExplorer component with interactive sliders based on the existing InputSlider component.
### Details:
Create a new ScenarioExplorer.tsx component that will contain the interactive scenario exploration functionality. Style and extend the existing InputSlider component to create InteractiveSlider components that allow users to adjust key ROI variables. Ensure the sliders have proper labels, min/max values, and step increments. Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state management. Follow the design system guidelines for consistent styling.

## 2. Implement state management and real-time ROI calculations [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Set up local state management for scenario inputs and create a wrapper function for recalculating ROI metrics in real-time.
### Details:
Implement useState hooks to manage the state of all adjustable variables in the scenario explorer. Create a calculateScenarioROI() wrapper function that calls the existing calculateROIMetrics with the scenario values. Optimize performance using useMemo to prevent unnecessary recalculations. Ensure the state updates trigger re-renders efficiently without performance issues. Include proper error handling for edge cases in calculations.

## 3. Design and implement the scenario results display [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create a visual display for showing the updated ROI metrics based on the scenario adjustments made by users.
### Details:
Design and implement a results display section that shows the updated ROI metrics in real-time as users adjust the sliders. Use existing metric components with animations to highlight changes. Include comparative views showing the difference between baseline and scenario results. Ensure the display is visually appealing and easy to understand at a glance. Add tooltips or help text to explain the significance of each metric.

## 4. Ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3
### Description: Optimize the Scenario Explorer for mobile devices and ensure it meets accessibility standards.
### Details:
Implement responsive design for the Scenario Explorer to ensure it works well on mobile devices. Adjust slider controls for touch interfaces with appropriate hit areas. Ensure text remains readable on small screens. Implement accessible slider controls with keyboard navigation, proper ARIA attributes, and screen reader support. Test with various device sizes and orientations to ensure a consistent user experience across platforms.

## 5. Integrate Scenario Explorer into the main application flow [done]
### Dependencies: 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Position the Scenario Explorer in the correct location within the application flow and connect it with existing components.
### Details:
Integrate the completed Scenario Explorer into the main application flow, placing it after the results section and before the CTA as specified in the PRD. Connect the explorer to the existing application state to ensure it has access to the baseline ROI metrics for comparison. Add smooth transitions when the explorer becomes visible. Ensure the explorer doesn't disrupt the overall user flow but enhances the experience by providing additional value through interactive exploration.
