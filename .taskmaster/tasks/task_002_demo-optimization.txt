# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Premium Service Badge System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a persistent, animated badge/banner communicating the three pillars of the premium service across all main pages.
# Details:
Create a `PremiumServiceBadge` React component with glassmorphic styling using Tailwind CSS and CSS backdrop filters. Animate entry with Framer Motion. Ensure mobile responsiveness (vertical stack on mobile). Integrate into Hero, Explorer, and Calculator pages. Use SVG icons for clarity. Respect prefers-reduced-motion for accessibility.

Extend the badge functionality to incorporate pain-point messaging while maintaining existing features. Update the messaging to include "Custom-Made Solutions for Your Challenges" alongside the three pillars. Modify the Hero section to include the Dutch headline "Worsteling met Multi-Platform Content Marketing?" and subheadline "Ontdek de All-in-One AI Marketing Machine". Ensure the badge implementation creates a natural flow where the Hero identifies the problem, the Badge presents the premium solution, and the 3D sphere demonstrates how it works. This integration should enhance conversion by addressing pain points while preserving the visual appeal of existing elements.
