Implement Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS) Framework across all copy. Follow this structure for all content:

1. Apply PAS framework to hero page with new Dutch copy:
   - H1: "Worsteling met Multi-Platform Content Marketing?"
   - H2: "Ontdek de All-in-One AI Marketing Machine die 24/7 voor je werkt"
   - Above stats: "Gemiddelde resultaten voor bedrijven die deze problemen oplosten:"
   - CTA: "Ontdek Hoe We Jouw Problemen Oplossen →"

2. Map 7 key pain points to corresponding modules:
   - Time-consuming manual content → Content Pipeline
   - Multi-platform chaos → Command Center
   - Inconsistent posting → Publishing Layer
   - Can't measure ROI → Analytics & Monitoring
   - Can't keep up with trends → Research & Planning
   - Expensive to hire team → Calculator
   - No automation expertise → AI Advisory Service

3. Restructure all explorer module copy with three-part format:
   - Section 1: "Het Probleem" - Pain statement with cost/consequence metrics
   - Section 2: "De Oplossing" - Existing capabilities description
   - Section 3: "Het Resultaat" - Metrics with added savings calculations

4. Update calculator copy with comparison framework:
   - Pre-section: "Wat kost je huidige aanpak je elke maand?"
   - Results intro: "Jouw Situatie vs Met Future Marketing AI"
   - Left column: "Nu (Handmatig)"
   - Right column: "Met Automatisering"

All copy must use informal Dutch ("je/jouw"), focus on benefits, lead with problems, and emphasize concrete results.
