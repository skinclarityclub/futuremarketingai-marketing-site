# Task ID: 10
# Title: Optimize for Mobile Responsiveness and Performance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Ensure flawless experience on all devices, optimize load times, and implement mobile-specific features.
# Details:
Audit all components for responsive design using Tailwind's mobile-first utilities. Use React Suspense/lazy for heavy components. Optimize images (next/image), compress 3D assets, and reduce bundle size (analyze with Source Map Explorer). Implement swipe gestures (react-swipeable) and bottom-sheet modals (Radix UI or custom). Add sticky CTA bar for mobile. Test on iOS Safari and Android Chrome.

# Test Strategy:
Automated Lighthouse audits for performance and accessibility. Manual device testing (BrowserStack/real devices) for UI breakage and touch interactions.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit and Refactor for Responsive Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review all UI components to ensure mobile-first responsiveness using Tailwind CSS utilities and address any layout or usability issues across device sizes.
### Details:
Systematically audit each component for mobile responsiveness, applying Tailwind's responsive classes and testing for breakpoints. Refactor layouts and spacing as needed to ensure a seamless experience on all devices.

## 2. Optimize Asset Loading and Bundle Size [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement code splitting, lazy loading, and asset optimization to reduce initial load times and improve runtime performance on mobile devices.
### Details:
Use React.lazy and Suspense for heavy components, optimize images with next/image, compress 3D assets, and analyze bundle size with Source Map Explorer. Apply tree shaking and minimize third-party dependencies.

## 3. Implement Mobile-Specific Interactions and Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Add and refine mobile-centric features such as swipe gestures, bottom-sheet modals, and a sticky CTA bar to enhance usability on touch devices.
### Details:
Integrate react-swipeable for gesture support, implement bottom-sheet modals using Radix UI or custom solutions, and add a persistent sticky CTA bar for mobile users.

## 4. Comprehensive Mobile Performance and UX Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of the application on real devices and emulators to identify and resolve mobile-specific performance or usability issues.
### Details:
Perform manual and automated tests on iOS Safari and Android Chrome, focusing on load times, UI breakage, touch interactions, and accessibility. Use Lighthouse and BrowserStack for coverage.

## 5. Continuous Monitoring and Regression Prevention [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Establish ongoing monitoring and regression testing to maintain mobile performance and responsiveness as the codebase evolves.
### Details:
Set up automated Lighthouse audits in CI, monitor performance metrics, and create regression tests for critical mobile features. Regularly review analytics for mobile user engagement.
