Position the AI Advisory Service as a solution to the "No Automation Expertise" pain point with the following integration strategy:

1. Set module title to "AI-Adviseur Partnership - Jouw Strategische Gids"
2. Add pain point badge with text "Oplost: Geen automatisering expertise nodig"
3. Include opening modal copy: "Geen technische kennis? Geen probleem. Ik begeleid je bij elke stap."

Enhance the HolographicInfoPanel component:
- Add optional `painPoint` prop
- Display "Oplost: [pain]" badge when painPoint exists
- Include "Saves you: â‚¬X/month" cost savings pill at bottom

Integrate with other modules using specific pain-point badges:
- Research Hub: "Oplost: Can't keep up with trends"
- Content Pipeline: "Oplost: Time-consuming manual content"
- Publishing: "Oplost: Inconsistent posting schedules"
- Analytics: "Oplost: Unable to measure ROI"
- Command Center: "Oplost: Multi-platform chaos"

Each module should clearly communicate the problem it solves before explaining how it works.
