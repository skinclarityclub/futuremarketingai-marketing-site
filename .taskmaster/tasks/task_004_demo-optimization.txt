# Task ID: 4
# Title: Deploy Strategic CTA Placement and Booking Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement prominent, contextual CTAs at key moments, including Calendly integration and exit-intent capture.
# Details:
Develop a reusable `StrategicCTA` component with gradient/glow styling. Integrate Calendly via their official React widget or embed API. Implement floating CTA (Hero), contextual CTAs (Explorer, Calculator), and exit-intent modal (use react-use for mouse events). Pre-fill booking modal with calculator data via props/context. Add trust indicators below CTAs. Ensure modals are accessible and mobile-friendly.

# Test Strategy:
E2E test CTA visibility, clickability, and booking flow. Simulate exit intent and verify modal triggers only once per session. Validate data pre-fill and fallback contact form.
