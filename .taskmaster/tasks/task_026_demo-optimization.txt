## Implementation Details:

### 1. Update IndustrySelector Component
```typescript
// src/components/common/IndustrySelector.tsx
export const INDUSTRIES = [
  {
    id: 'ecommerce',
    name: 'E-commerce & Retail',
    icon: ShoppingBagIcon,
    proxyIndicators: ['product catalog', 'conversion optimization', 'customer retention']
  },
  {
    id: 'saas',
    name: 'Technology & SaaS',
    icon: CodeBracketIcon,
    proxyIndicators: ['user acquisition', 'product adoption', 'churn reduction']
  },
  {
    id: 'agency',
    name: 'Professional Services / Agency',
    icon: BriefcaseIcon,
    proxyIndicators: ['client acquisition', 'project management', 'service delivery']
  },
  {
    id: 'other',
    name: 'Other Industry',
    icon: BuildingOfficeIcon,
    proxyIndicators: ['business growth', 'marketing efficiency', 'customer engagement']
  }
];
```

- Update the grid layout from 3x3 to 2x2:
```tsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  {INDUSTRIES.map((industry) => (
    <IndustryCard 
      key={industry.id}
      industry={industry}
      selected={selectedIndustry === industry.id}
      onSelect={() => handleIndustrySelect(industry.id)}
    />
  ))}
</div>
```

### 2. Update Industry Personalization Config
```typescript
// src/config/industryPersonalization.ts
export const industryBenchmarks = {
  ecommerce: {
    conversionRate: 3.2,
    customerAcquisitionCost: 45,
    // other ecommerce-specific benchmarks
  },
  saas: {
    conversionRate: 2.5,
    customerAcquisitionCost: 120,
    // other saas-specific benchmarks
  },
  agency: {
    conversionRate: 4.8,
    customerAcquisitionCost: 250,
    // other agency-specific benchmarks
  },
  other: {
    // generic fallback benchmarks
    conversionRate: 3.0,
    customerAcquisitionCost: 80,
  }
};

// Remove all other industry-specific configurations and keep only the 4 required ones
export const industryModulePriorities = {
  ecommerce: ['productCatalog', 'customerRetention', 'conversionRate'],
  saas: ['userAcquisition', 'churnReduction', 'customerSuccess'],
  agency: ['leadGeneration', 'clientRetention', 'projectManagement'],
  other: ['marketingEfficiency', 'leadGeneration', 'customerEngagement']
};

// Update testimonials to only include the 4 industries
export const industryTestimonials = {
  ecommerce: [...],
  saas: [...],
  agency: [...],
  other: [...]
};

// Update messaging configs
export const industryMessaging = {
  ecommerce: {
    headline: "Autonomous Marketing for E-commerce & Retail",
    painPoints: ["abandoned carts", "customer acquisition costs", "retention challenges"],
    // other messaging elements
  },
  saas: {
    headline: "Autonomous Marketing for SaaS Companies",
    painPoints: ["high CAC", "churn reduction", "product adoption"],
    // other messaging elements
  },
  agency: {
    headline: "Autonomous Marketing for Agencies",
    painPoints: ["client acquisition", "scaling services", "demonstrating ROI"],
    // other messaging elements
  },
  other: {
    headline: "Autonomous Marketing for Your Business",
    painPoints: ["marketing efficiency", "lead generation", "growth challenges"],
    // generic messaging elements
  }
};
```

### 3. Update Translation Files
- Remove unused industry translations from all locale files (EN, NL, ES)
- Example for English locale:
```json
// locales/en/common.json
{
  "industries": {
    "ecommerce": "E-commerce & Retail",
    "saas": "Technology & SaaS",
    "agency": "Professional Services / Agency",
    "other": "Other Industry"
  },
  // Remove all other industry translations
}
```

### 4. Update Personalization Logic
```typescript
// src/utils/personalization.ts
export function getIndustryDefaults(industry: string) {
  // Ensure we have a valid industry or default to 'other'
  const validIndustry = ['ecommerce', 'saas', 'agency'].includes(industry) 
    ? industry 
    : 'other';
    
  return {
    benchmarks: industryBenchmarks[validIndustry],
    modulePriorities: industryModulePriorities[validIndustry],
    messaging: industryMessaging[validIndustry],
    testimonials: industryTestimonials[validIndustry]
  };
}
```

### 5. Update Tests & Documentation
- Update IndustrySelector tests to verify only 4 options are available
- Update integration tests to use only valid industry values
- Update documentation to reflect the simplified industry options

### 6. Clean Up Unused Code
- Remove any industry-specific components, images, or assets for removed industries
- Update any hardcoded industry references throughout the codebase

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update IndustrySelector Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the IndustrySelector component to display only the 4 required industries (E-commerce, SaaS, Agency, Other) and update the grid layout from 3x3 to 2x2.
### Details:
Update the INDUSTRIES array in src/components/common/IndustrySelector.tsx to include only the 4 required industries. Modify the grid layout CSS classes from 3x3 to 2x2 (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2). Ensure the IndustryCard component works correctly with the updated industry data structure. Test the responsive behavior on mobile and desktop views.
<info added on 2025-10-08T00:11:17.792Z>
The subtask has been completed successfully with the following changes to the IndustrySelector component:

1. Reduced industry options from 10 to 4:
   - E-commerce & Retail (id: 'ecommerce')
   - Technology & SaaS (id: 'saas', previously 'technology')
   - Marketing Agency (id: 'agency', previously 'professional')
   - Other Industry (id: 'other')

2. Updated grid layout from 3x3 to 2x2:
   - Changed from grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 to grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2
   - Mobile view displays as a single column
   - Desktop view displays as a 2x2 grid

3. Industry ID changes that will require migration handling:
   - 'professional' → 'agency'
   - 'technology' → 'saas'

4. All proxy indicators for the industries have been preserved.

The implementation creates a cleaner user experience with reduced cognitive load and better alignment with primary ICP segments.

## 2. Update Industry Personalization Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Modify all industry-specific configuration files to include only the 4 required industries and remove all unused industry data.
### Details:
Update src/config/industryPersonalization.ts to include only ecommerce, saas, agency, and other industries. Remove all other industry-specific configurations from industryBenchmarks, industryModulePriorities, industryTestimonials, and industryMessaging objects. Ensure all industry-specific data is properly structured and complete for the 4 remaining industries.
<info added on 2025-10-08T00:13:59.261Z>
All industry-specific configuration data has been streamlined to only include the 4 primary industries: ecommerce, saas, agency, and other.

Changes Made:

1. INDUSTRY_BENCHMARKS Updated:
   - Renamed 'technology' → 'saas'
   - Renamed 'professional' → 'agency'
   - Removed: healthcare, finance, real-estate, education, hospitality, manufacturing
   - Retained: ecommerce, saas, agency, other

2. MODULE_PRIORITIES Updated:
   - Same ID changes and removals as benchmarks
   - Priority ordering maintained for the 4 industries
   - 'other' remains with balanced priority across all modules

3. TESTIMONIALS Array Streamlined:
   - Before: 8 testimonials (1 per removed industry)
   - After: 3 testimonials (1 per primary ICP)
   - Kept: ecom-1 (Mike Chen), saas-1 (Sarah Johnson), agency-1 (Robert Anderson)
   - Removed: health-1, finance-1, realestate-1, edu-1, hosp-1
   - Updated industry IDs in remaining testimonials

   - Updated IDs: 'technology' → 'saas', 'professional' → 'agency'
   - Removed messaging for 6 industries
   - Retained hero subtitles, calculator intros, CTAs, and value propositions for the 4 industries

5. Helper Functions:
   - getIndustryMessaging(), getIndustryBenchmarks(), getModulePriorities() - already use fallback to 'other'
   - No changes needed, they will handle the new structure automatically

Impact:
- Significantly reduced file size and complexity
- All personalization logic now only operates on the 4 ICP-aligned industries
- Fallback to 'other' ensures no breaking changes for edge cases
- Better maintainability with focused configuration

Files Modified:

## 3. Update Translation Files for Industry Labels [done]
### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Remove unused industry translations from all locale files and ensure the 4 remaining industries have proper translations.
### Details:
Update translation files in locales/en/common.json, locales/nl/common.json, and locales/es/common.json to remove all unused industry translations. Keep only translations for 'ecommerce', 'saas', 'agency', and 'other' industries. Verify that all translations are consistent across language files and match the industry names in the IndustrySelector component.
<info added on 2025-10-08T00:15:16.500Z>
Translation files have been updated to include only the 4 primary industries across language files. Modified files include public/locales/en/forms.json and public/locales/nl/forms.json. The English translations now show "E-commerce & Retail", "Technology & SaaS", "Marketing Agency", and "Other Industry". Dutch translations were similarly updated to "E-commerce & Retail", "Technologie & SaaS", "Marketing Bureau", and "Andere Branche". No changes were needed for Spanish as the forms.json file doesn't exist. This update ensures consistency across the application, simplifies the user experience with focused industry options, and aligns with our ICP strategy. All dropdowns and form fields now display only these 4 industry options.
