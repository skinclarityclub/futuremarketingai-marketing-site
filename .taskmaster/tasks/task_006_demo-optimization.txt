Implement pain-point focused testimonials with the following structure:
- Photo + Name + Company + Industry
- Pain Point: "We hadden [specific problem]"
- Solution Impact: "Future Marketing AI loste dit op door [solution]"
- Result: "Nu hebben we [specific outcome with metrics]"

Example testimonial: "We verloren €5K/maand aan inefficiënte content processen. Future Marketing AI automatiseerde alles. Nu besparen we 80 uur per maand en onze engagement is 3x hoger." - Lisa van Dam, Founder @ EcoShop NL

Reframe aggregate metrics to focus on pain points:
- Change "€2.5M+ Saved" to "€2.5M+ aan verspilde tijd teruggewonnen"
- Change "50K+ Content" to "50K+ posts zonder een enkel uur handmatig werk"
- Change "20+ Businesses" to "20+ bedrijven los van content chaos"

Format case study cards with: Industry + Pain Point + Solution + Results
Example: "E-commerce | Geen tijd voor social media | Complete automatisering | 5x meer posts, 3x ROI"
