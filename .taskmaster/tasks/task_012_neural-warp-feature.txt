All progressive pricing discount calculations have been verified. The calculations in platformKnowledge.ts valueBreakdown are accurate with the updated retail value of â‚¬39,000:

- Pioneer (â‚¬17,500): 55% off â‚¬39,000 = â‚¬21,500/month savings
- Innovator (â‚¬20,000): 49% off â‚¬39,000 = â‚¬19,000/month savings
- Standard (â‚¬22,500): 42% off â‚¬39,000 = â‚¬16,500/month savings

Validation confirms that all discount calculations are mathematically correct, the Year 1 savings formula accounts for 2 free months, progressive tier discounts are properly graduated, and all components use platformKnowledge.ts as the single source of truth.
