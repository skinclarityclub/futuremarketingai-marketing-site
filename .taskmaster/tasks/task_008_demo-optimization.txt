# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Personalized Demo Paths and Progressive Profiling
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Adapt demo content based on user inputs and behaviors, including industry selection and dynamic module/testimonial ordering.
# Details:
Create `IndustrySelector` modal (Hero or pre-Calculator). Store selection in Zustand context, localStorage, and URL params. Use context to personalize calculator benchmarks, Explorer module order, and testimonial selection. Implement progressive profiling: prompt for more info as user interacts. Ensure all flows are non-blocking and mobile-friendly.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for context propagation and personalization logic. Manually verify dynamic content and progressive data collection.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create IndustrySelector Modal Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a modal component for industry selection that appears on Hero section or before Calculator, with industry options and smooth animations
### Details:
Develop `IndustrySelector` React component with modal overlay, industry dropdown/grid selection, Framer Motion animations, and mobile-responsive design. Include common industries like Healthcare, Financial Services, Manufacturing, Technology, etc. Style with glassmorphic design matching existing components.

## 2. Implement Context and Storage Management [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Set up Zustand context store for user preferences and implement localStorage and URL parameter synchronization
### Details:
Create Zustand store for user personalization data (industry, preferences, profile data). Implement localStorage persistence and URL parameter sync for shareable personalized states. Add context provider wrapper and hooks for accessing personalization data across components.

## 3. Build Dynamic Content Personalization Engine [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create system to personalize calculator benchmarks, Explorer module ordering, and testimonial selection based on user context
### Details:
Implement personalization logic that adapts calculator industry benchmarks, reorders Explorer modules based on industry relevance, and filters testimonials by industry/role. Create modular content blocks and industry-specific configuration files. Ensure fallback content for unselected industries.

## Implementation Results

Personalization engine successfully integrated across Calculator, Hero, and Explorer components with the following implementations:

**Calculator Integration:**
- Default values now use industry-specific benchmarks: `avgTeamSize`, `avgSalary`, and `avgCampaignsPerMonth`
- Industry name appears in calculator title: "ROI Calculator • Technology & SaaS"
- Subtitle displays industry-specific messaging from `messaging.calculatorIntro`
- Industry selection triggers display of relevant `benchmarks.description`

**Hero Integration:**
- Subtitle now uses industry-specific messaging from `messaging.heroSubtitle`
- Targeting businesses in €250k-€2M range
- Industry-specific value propositions implemented (e.g., "Voor scale-ups die content output willen verdubbelen zonder extra developers/marketers in te huren")

**Explorer Integration:**
- Module ordering now prioritized by industry relevance using `sortModules(features)` function
- Technology & SaaS users see Research → Content → Analytics sequence
- E-commerce users see Analytics → Content → Publishing sequence
- Testimonial filtering variable implemented (ready for rendering)

All personalization elements maintain subtle but effective targeting focused on small teams (2-8 FTE), owner/founder messaging, and "scale without headcount" value proposition.

## 4. Implement Progressive Profiling System [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create non-intrusive progressive profiling that collects additional user information as they interact with the demo
### Details:
Build progressive profiling components that appear at strategic moments (after calculator completion, during Explorer navigation). Collect role, company size, specific use cases, and pain points. Design as optional, dismissible prompts that enhance personalization without blocking user flow.

## 5. Ensure Mobile-Friendly Personalization Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Optimize all personalization components and flows for mobile devices with responsive design and touch interactions
### Details:
Adapt IndustrySelector modal, progressive profiling prompts, and personalized content for mobile viewports. Implement touch-friendly interactions, proper modal sizing, and readable text. Ensure personalization features work seamlessly across all device sizes without compromising user experience.
