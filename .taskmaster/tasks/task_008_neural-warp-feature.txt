# Task ID: 8
# Title: Analytics, Performance Monitoring, and Error Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement analytics event tracking, performance monitoring, error boundaries, and graceful degradation for the animation lifecycle.
# Details:
Track events: animation start, phase transitions, completion, skips, performance metrics, and errors using the existing analytics system (e.g., Segment, Amplitude, or custom). Monitor FPS and dropped frames, and trigger adaptive quality or fallback as needed. Wrap NeuralWarpTransition in an ErrorBoundary that falls back to SimpleFadeTransition. Implement timeout protection and handle Canvas/WebGL context loss. Use feature detection for progressive enhancement.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for analytics event emission. Simulate errors and verify fallback. Integration tests for performance monitoring and adaptive quality. E2E tests for error and timeout scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Analytics Event Tracking for Animation Lifecycle [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement analytics event emission for animation start, phase transitions, completion, skips, performance metrics, and errors using the existing analytics system.
### Details:
Hook into animation lifecycle events (start, phase change, end, skip) and emit structured analytics events to Segment, Amplitude, or the custom analytics system. Ensure all relevant data (e.g., animation name, elapsed time, error details) is included. Use React event handlers and effect hooks to capture these events.

## 2. Implement Performance Monitoring and Adaptive Quality Triggers [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Monitor animation performance (FPS, dropped frames) and trigger adaptive quality or fallback transitions as needed.
### Details:
Set up real-time FPS and dropped frame monitoring within the animation loop. Define thresholds for quality downgrade or fallback. When thresholds are exceeded, trigger adaptive quality logic or switch to fallback animation. Log performance metrics to analytics.

## 3. Wrap NeuralWarpTransition in Error Boundary with Fallback [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement an ErrorBoundary component that wraps NeuralWarpTransition and falls back to SimpleFadeTransition on error.
### Details:
Create a React ErrorBoundary that catches rendering and runtime errors in NeuralWarpTransition. On error, render SimpleFadeTransition and emit an error event to analytics. Ensure fallback is seamless and user experience is preserved.

## 4. Handle Animation Timeout and Canvas/WebGL Context Loss [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Implement timeout protection for long-running animations and handle Canvas/WebGL context loss gracefully.
### Details:
Set a maximum duration for animation phases and trigger fallback or skip if exceeded. Listen for context loss events on Canvas/WebGL and attempt recovery or fallback to SimpleFadeTransition. Emit relevant analytics events for timeouts and context loss.

## 5. Add Feature Detection for Progressive Enhancement [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Use feature detection to enable or disable advanced animation features based on browser and device capabilities.
### Details:
Detect support for required APIs (e.g., WebGL, OffscreenCanvas, animation frame timing) before enabling advanced features. If unsupported, automatically use fallback transitions. Ensure detection logic is robust and analytics capture feature support status.
