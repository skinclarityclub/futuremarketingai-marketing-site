# Task ID: 7
# Title: Integrate Global Interactions, Responsiveness, and Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement centralized mouse tracking, parallax effects, scroll-based 3D rotation, idle state animations, responsive design, and accessibility/performance optimizations.
# Details:
Create a global mouse tracker hook (useMousePosition) updating at 60fps with lerp smoothing. Apply parallax offsets to BackgroundGrid, AmbientParticleField, CoreSphere3D, and SatelliteNode. Implement scroll event throttling and 3D core rotation. Add idle state animations (breathing, energy pulse, particle clustering) using GSAP or requestAnimationFrame. Use Intersection Observer to pause animations when off-screen. Implement responsive breakpoints for desktop/tablet/mobile, reducing particle count and simplifying features as needed. Add reduced motion support (prefers-reduced-motion), disabling continuous animations and limiting particle count. Conduct accessibility audits (keyboard, ARIA, color contrast) and performance profiling (Lighthouse, Chrome DevTools). Apply final visual polish and cross-browser fixes.

# Test Strategy:
Test all mouse and scroll interactions for smoothness and correctness. Validate responsiveness on various devices and orientations. Confirm reduced motion mode disables animations. Run accessibility tests (keyboard, screen reader, color contrast). Profile FPS, CPU/GPU usage, and bundle size. Verify all success criteria from PRD.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Centralized Mouse Tracking with Lerp Smoothing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a global mouse tracker hook (useMousePosition) that updates mouse coordinates at 60fps using linear interpolation (lerp) for smooth transitions.
### Details:
Develop a React hook that listens to mouse movement events, normalizes coordinates, and applies lerp smoothing. Ensure the hook provides real-time, smoothed mouse position data for use by other components.

## 2. Apply Parallax Effects to Key Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Integrate parallax offsets into BackgroundGrid, AmbientParticleField, CoreSphere3D, and SatelliteNode based on global mouse position.
### Details:
Use the smoothed mouse position from the global tracker to calculate and apply parallax transformations to each target component. Ensure offsets are visually consistent and performance-optimized.

## 3. Implement Scroll-Based 3D Rotation and Idle State Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Throttle scroll events and rotate the CoreSphere3D in 3D space. Add idle state animations (breathing, energy pulse, particle clustering) using GSAP or requestAnimationFrame.
### Details:
Set up scroll event listeners with throttling to trigger 3D rotation of the core sphere. Use GSAP or requestAnimationFrame to animate idle states, pausing animations when off-screen via Intersection Observer.

## 4. Implement Responsive Design and Reduced Motion Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Add responsive breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile. Reduce particle count and simplify features on smaller devices. Support prefers-reduced-motion to disable continuous animations and limit particle count.
### Details:
Configure CSS and JS logic for breakpoints, adapting layout and feature complexity. Detect prefers-reduced-motion and adjust animation and particle settings accordingly.

## 5. Conduct Accessibility Audits and Performance Profiling [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Perform accessibility audits (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, color contrast) and profile performance (FPS, CPU/GPU usage, bundle size). Apply final visual polish and cross-browser fixes.
### Details:
Use tools like Lighthouse and Chrome DevTools to assess accessibility and performance. Address issues found, polish visuals, and ensure compatibility across major browsers.
