# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Dependency Installation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository, configure the file structure, and install all required dependencies for SystemDiagram 3.0.
# Details:
Set up a new or existing React project (preferably with TypeScript). Install and configure the following dependencies: three@^0.160.0, @react-three/fiber@^8.15.0, @react-three/drei@^9.92.0, gsap@^3.12.0. Organize the src/components/SystemDiagram3 directory as specified in the PRD. Ensure code-splitting and lazy loading for heavy components (e.g., CoreSphere3D). Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality. Add scripts for performance profiling and bundle analysis. Configure Webpack or Vite for tree-shaking and optimal bundle size. Prepare a test runner (Jest + React Testing Library) and Storybook for component isolation.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all dependencies are installed and importable. Run a basic render test for each core dependency. Confirm project builds and runs in development and production modes. Check that the initial bundle size is within the performance budget.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize React Project with TypeScript [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new or existing React project using TypeScript, ensuring the initial repository and configuration files are in place.
### Details:
Use Create React App with the TypeScript template or add TypeScript to an existing project. Ensure tsconfig.json is present and configured for strict type checking. Verify .tsx support and initial directory structure.

## 2. Install and Configure Core Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install all required libraries for 3D rendering, animation, and component development as specified for SystemDiagram 3.0.
### Details:
Install three@^0.160.0, @react-three/fiber@^8.15.0, @react-three/drei@^9.92.0, and gsap@^3.12.0. Verify all dependencies are listed in package.json and importable in the codebase.

## 3. Organize File Structure and SystemDiagram3 Directory [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Create and structure the src/components/SystemDiagram3 directory according to the PRD, preparing for modular development.
### Details:
Set up the directory and subdirectories for components, utilities, and assets as outlined in the PRD. Ensure clear separation of concerns and readiness for code-splitting.

## 4. Configure Code Quality and Tooling [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code linting, formatting, and pre-commit hooks. Add scripts for performance profiling and bundle analysis.
### Details:
Install and configure ESLint with TypeScript support, Prettier for formatting, and Husky for git hooks. Add npm scripts for profiling (e.g., using react-scripts or custom scripts) and bundle analysis (e.g., webpack-bundle-analyzer).

## 5. Set Up Build Optimization, Testing, and Storybook [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Configure Webpack or Vite for tree-shaking and optimal bundle size, enable code-splitting and lazy loading, and set up Jest, React Testing Library, and Storybook.
### Details:
Adjust build configuration for tree-shaking and code-splitting (e.g., dynamic imports for heavy components). Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration tests. Install and configure Storybook for component isolation and documentation.
