# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement State-of-the-Art AI Journey Assistant as Demo Centerpiece
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 5, 8, 13, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a unified, context-aware AI Journey Assistant that combines journey guidance, Q&A, proactive tips, demo scheduling, and lead qualification, serving as the flagship interactive feature of the demo experience.
# Details:
1. **Architecture & Planning:**
   - Define clear objectives and KPIs (engagement, completion, satisfaction) aligned with demo goals.
   - Design a modular React component architecture using TypeScript, with Zustand for chat and journey state, and Framer Motion for smooth, accessible animations.
   - Integrate with personalizationStore and progressive profiling logic for tailored experiences.
   - Plan for phased implementation: core UI, journey logic, Q&A, personalization, gamification, and future AI integration.

2. **Core UI Implementation:**
   - Build a floating action button (right-middle, breathing animation) that expands to a glassmorphic chat panel (desktop) or mobile bottom sheet.
   - Ensure ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).
   - Implement message history, visual progress indicators, and achievement badges.
   - Lazy load chat assets for performance and respect prefers-reduced-motion.

3. **Journey Guidance & Contextual Logic:**
   - Implement adaptive step-by-step demo paths based on industry/role, leveraging existing personalization and progressive profiling.
   - Track user progress, viewed modules, and milestones; trigger contextual nudges (e.g., after 3 modules, on ROI Calculator, on completion).
   - Integrate with Calendly for demo scheduling, pre-filling user data where available.

4. **Q&A and Proactive Support:**
   - Develop a natural language Q&A mode using a mock knowledge base (expandable to LLM/RAG in future phase).
   - Provide fallback responses and clear escalation paths to human support if needed.
   - Design conversation flows with friendly, professional tone and context-aware suggestions.

5. **Personalization & Gamification:**
   - Use ICP scoring and personalizationStore to tailor content, tips, and journey paths.
   - Implement gamified elements: badges, progress bars, and celebratory animations on completion.

6. **Analytics & Persistence:**
   - Track engagement, completion, and booking events via GA4.
   - Persist chat and journey state in localStorage for session continuity.

7. **Best Practices:**
   - Co-design and test with real users for feedback-driven iteration.
   - Ensure seamless integration with demo modules, CTA system, and personalization flows.
   - Prepare for future AI integration (WebSocket/real-time updates, LLM backend).

**References:**
- Follow best-in-class patterns from Intercom, Drift, Notion AI, Linear, and Superhuman for UI/UX, proactive support, and gamification[1][2][4][5][6][7].
- Adhere to enterprise AI implementation best practices: phased rollout, user testing, continuous improvement, and ethical compliance[3][4][5][7][8].

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit & Integration Testing:**
   - Test all UI components (floating button, chat panel, progress indicators) for rendering, accessibility, and responsiveness (Jest, React Testing Library).
   - Validate Zustand state management, personalization logic, and localStorage persistence.
   - Simulate journey flows: industry selection, module viewing, ROI calculation, and demo booking triggers.
   - Test Q&A fallback and escalation logic.

2. **E2E & Manual Testing:**
   - Verify contextual triggers, proactive nudges, and gamification events fire at correct milestones.
   - Confirm Calendly integration and data pre-fill.
   - Manually test on all supported devices and browsers for mobile-first, accessible experience.
   - Measure UI response times (<200ms), AI response times (<1s, mock), and lazy loading behavior.

3. **Analytics & Success Metrics:**
   - Validate GA4 event tracking for chat engagement, journey completion, and demo bookings.
   - Collect user feedback and iterate based on satisfaction scores and observed friction points.

# 🐛 Fixed: Proactive Suggestions Click Handler

## Problem:
"Misschien interessant" vragen (Proactive Suggestions) hadden geen werkende click handler. Klikken deed niets.

## Root Cause:
Handler in ChatPanel.tsx gebruikte `addMessage` (bestaat niet) in plaats van `addUserMessage`, en triggerde geen bot response via `generateResponse`.

## Fix Applied:
Geïmplementeerd **volledige message flow** zoals ChatInput:

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER (COMPLETE FLOW):
onQuestionClick={async (question) => {
  // 1. Add user message
  addUserMessage(question)
  
  // 2. Show typing indicator
  setTyping(true)
  
  // 3. Build context
  const context = {
    industryId, icpScore, modulesExplored, timeOnSite, messagesCount
  }
  
  // 4. Generate response
  const response = await generateResponse(question, context, messages)
  
  // 5. Add bot response (with 500ms delay)
  setTimeout(() => {
    setTyping(false)
    if (response.type === 'navigation') addNavigationMessage(...)
    else if (response.type === 'quick-replies') addQuickRepliesMessage(...)
    else addSystemMessage(...)
  }, 500)
}
```

## Testing:
- [x] Click "Hoe helpt dit e-commerce bedrijven?" → Bot responds
- [x] Click "Wat is de AI Ad Builder?" → Bot responds
- [x] Typing indicator shows during response generation
- [x] Response type handled correctly (text/navigation/quick-replies)

## Status: ✅ FIXED
