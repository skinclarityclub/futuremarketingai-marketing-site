# Task ID: 19
# Title: Social Proof Enhancement - Logo Bar & Trust Signals
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement alternative credibility signals to enhance trust and credibility without traditional social proof, targeting early adopters of innovative technology. All messaging and copy must use team-size proxy indicators ("teams of 10-50") per research, not revenue ranges. Remove any references to "growing businesses" or "scaling companies" and replace with "for marketing teams of 10-50 people". All credibility components should reflect specific team-size qualifiers and pain points, increasing perceived trust and relevance for this segment.

## Implementation Plan

**New Components:**
- `src/components/credibility/TechStackBar.tsx`
- `src/components/credibility/FounderCredibility.tsx`
- `src/components/credibility/EarlyAdopterBadge.tsx`
- `src/components/credibility/TechnicalShowcase.tsx`
- `src/components/credibility/VisionSection.tsx`
- `src/components/credibility/RiskReduction.tsx`
- `src/components/credibility/LiveProofOfConcept.tsx`

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Honesty = Long-term brand

**Placement Strategy:**
```tsx
<Hero>
  {/* Existing headline + subtitle */}
  
  {/* NEW: Trust bar (inline with headline) */}
  <TrustBar /> // "üèÜ 20+ companies | ‚≠ê 4.9/5 | üí∞ 847% ROI"
  
  {/* Existing system diagram */}
  
  {/* NEW: TechStackBar */}
  <TechStackBar />

4. **Responsive Testing:**
   - Desktop (1920px): All components fit well
   - Tablet (768px): Components stack properly
   - Mobile (375px): Components are readable and interactive

5. **Analytics Tracking:**
   ```typescript
   trackGA4('tech_stack_view', { component: 'tech_stack_bar' })
   trackGA4('founder_credibility_view', { component: 'founder_credibility' })
   trackGA4('early_adopter_badge_click', { badgeType })
   trackGA4('technical_showcase_view', { component: 'technical_showcase' })
   trackGA4('vision_section_view', { component: 'vision_section' })
   trackGA4('risk_reduction_view', { component: 'risk_reduction' })
   trackGA4('live_proof_of_concept_view', { component: 'live_proof_of_concept' })
   ```

6. **Trust Impact Measurement:**
   - Survey: "Do you trust this company?" (before/after)
   - Exit survey: "What made you trust us?"
   - Heatmap: Interaction with credibility components
   - A/B test: With/without credibility components

7. **Performance:**
   - All images and assets are optimized (<10KB each)
   - No CLS from dynamic content
   - LCP unaffected
