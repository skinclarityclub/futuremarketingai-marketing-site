# Subtasks:
## 1. Extend IndustrySelector and Create PersonalizationControlBar [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance the existing IndustrySelector component and create a new PersonalizationControlBar to provide persistent access to personalization controls.
### Details:
Modify the IndustrySelector from Task 8 to add a persistent 'Change Industry' button in the navigation bar. Create a new PersonalizationControlBar component that displays the current selected industry with an edit button. Ensure both components are styled consistently with the application design system. The PersonalizationControlBar should be visible across all pages and maintain state between page navigations.
<info added on 2025-10-05T22:23:39.955Z>
## Implementation Details:

PersonalizationControlBar component has been successfully created and integrated into the application with the following specifications:

The component is located at `src/components/common/PersonalizationControlBar.tsx` and features a glassmorphic floating button design positioned in the top-right corner on desktop and top-center on mobile. It displays the current industry icon and name along with an edit/settings icon that opens the IndustrySelector when clicked.

The component includes hover animations (icon rotation, scale, tooltip), only renders when an industry is selected, is fully responsive with different layouts for mobile and desktop, and provides touch-friendly interaction with proper tap states.

Integration is complete with the component exported in `src/components/common/index.ts` and added to App.tsx to render on all pages alongside FloatingNav. The component uses the existing `usePersonalizationStore` for state management and implements Framer Motion animations with stagger and spring physics.

Accessibility features include proper button semantics, touch-active class for mobile, and keyboard accessibility. The user flow allows for seamless industry selection and modification, with all personalized content updating appropriately upon changes.

The implementation is now ready for subtask 13.2 (UserPreferencesModal) to add more personalization controls.
