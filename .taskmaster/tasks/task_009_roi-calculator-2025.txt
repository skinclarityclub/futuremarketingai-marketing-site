✅ AUDIT COMPLETED & STRATEGY REVISED

**Critical Discovery:** This is a SUBPATH demo (`futuremarketingai.com/demo`), NOT a standalone homepage. Original audit assumed wrong strategy.

**Original Audit Issues:**
- Assumed standalone site (42/100, 36 hours work)
- Would compete with main homepage for keywords
- Recommended Organization schema (wrong for demo)
- Over-optimization for wrong goals

**Revised Subpath Strategy:**
- Score: 58/100 (acceptable for demo pages)
- Effort: 12-15 hours (66% less than original)
- Focus: Demo-specific SEO + conversion
- Keywords: "AI marketing demo", "ROI calculator" (not "AI marketing")
- Schema: WebApplication (not Organization)
- Internal linking: Strong links to/from main site

**Key Implementation Changes:**
✅ Demo-specific meta tags (1h)
✅ Open Graph for demo sharing (2h)
✅ WebApplication structured data (2h)
✅ Internal linking strategy (2h)
✅ useDemoSEO hook for dynamic tags (3h)
✅ Hreflang for 3 languages (2h)
✅ Canonical tags (included in hook)

**What NOT to Implement:**
❌ Organization schema (main site responsibility)
❌ Full robots.txt (main site handles)
❌ Broad keywords (would compete with main)
❌ Extensive sitemap (main site master)

**Documentation Created:**
- SEO-META-TAGS-AUDIT-SUBPATH-2025.md (revised audit for subpath)
- SEO-STRATEGY-DEMO-PAGES-2025.md (research + strategy)
- SEO-META-TAGS-AUDIT-2025.md (original - kept for reference)

**Status:** Audit complete, strategy correct for subpath demo. Ready for implementation (12-15h).
