## 🎨 **STRATEGIC FUNNEL DESIGN**

### **Hero Page (Top of Funnel - Awareness)**

**Goal:** Grab attention with vision and aspiration

**Components:**

1. **Hero Text + Sphere** → First impression
2. **TechStackBar** → "Who powers us" (social proof)
3. **VisionTimeline** → "Our journey" (existing, proven to work)
4. **Stats Grid** → "Early results"
5. **AggregateMetrics** → "What we achieve"
6. **PremiumBadge** → "What you get"
7. **ValueStackingSection** → "Platform value"
8. **TrustBadges** → "Security & compliance"
9. **StrategicCTA** → "Explore platform"

**Strategy:**

- Keep it **aspirational**, not transactional
- Focus on "**why now**" and "**what's possible**"
- Use **existing VisionTimeline** instead of new VisionSection
- NO technical details (save for Explorer)
- NO risk removal (save for Calculator)
- Clean, inspiring, forward-looking

---

### **Explorer Page (Middle of Funnel - Interest)**

**Goal:** Prove it's real with technical credibility

**Components:**

1. **Features Grid** → "What can it do?"
2. **ValueStackingSection** → "Combined platform value"
3. **TechnicalShowcase** → "Real architecture, not vaporware"
4. **FounderExpertise** → "15+ years experience, 3 founding teams"
5. **StrategicCTA** → "Calculate your ROI" or "Book demo"

**Strategy:**

- **Technical proof** → Show the real AI architecture
- **Team credibility** → 15+ years experience
- Mid-funnel is perfect for "**how**" and "**who**"
- Build trust through **transparency**

**Why these components HERE:**

- TechnicalShowcase = Technical validation (perfect for mid-funnel)
- FounderExpertise = Human validation (team credibility)
- Users exploring features WANT to know the tech is real
- Users exploring features WANT to know who built it

---

### **Calculator Page (Bottom of Funnel - Decision)**

**Goal:** Convert by removing objections and creating urgency

**Components:**

1. **ROI Calculator** → "What's MY specific value?"
2. **EarlyAdopterBadge** → "3 founding teams, 7 spots left" (urgency)
3. **RiskReduction** → "€5K ROI guarantee, no lock-in" (objection removal)
4. **VisionSection** → "Be ahead of 2027 curve" (FOMO through vision)
5. **SlotProgressIndicator** → "Founding 5: 3/10 spots taken" (scarcity)
6. **StrategicCTA** → "Book demo NOW"

**Strategy:**

- All conversion tools in ONE place
- Remove EVERY objection:
  - "Too risky?" → RiskReduction guarantees
  - "Not urgent?" → EarlyAdopterBadge + Slots scarcity
  - "Will it work?" → ROI Calculator proves value
  - "Too early?" → VisionSection shows you'll be ahead
- Bottom funnel = **conversion focused**

**Why these components HERE:**

- EarlyAdopterBadge = Urgency + Scarcity (conversion trigger)
- RiskReduction = Remove objections (conversion enabler)
- VisionSection = "Don't wait, be first" (FOMO trigger)
- Users at ROI stage are HIGH INTENT → hit them with everything
