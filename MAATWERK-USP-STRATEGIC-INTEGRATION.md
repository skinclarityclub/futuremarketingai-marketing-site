# 🎯 Maatwerk USP - Strategic Integration Plan

**Datum:** October 10, 2025  
**Research:** Custom-built software positioning best practices 2025  
**Goal:** Integrate "custom-built per business" as core differentiator

---

## 🔍 **RESEARCH INSIGHTS**

### **Why Custom-Built is a Killer USP:**

1. **Differentiation from SaaS:**

   ```
   Template-based SaaS:
   - ❌ One-size-fits-all
   - ❌ Force your process into their template
   - ❌ "Configure it yourself"
   - ❌ Compromises on workflow

   Custom-Built (You):
   - ✅ Tailored to YOUR business
   - ✅ Fits YOUR existing process
   - ✅ "Built FOR you" not "BY you"
   - ✅ Zero compromises
   ```

2. **Premium Positioning:**

   ```
   Template = Commodity pricing
   Custom-built = Premium value

   Justifies:
   - Higher price point
   - Longer commitment (1-year)
   - Setup time investment
   - Founding team exclusivity
   ```

3. **Trust Building:**
   ```
   "We build it FOR you" =
   - Personal attention
   - Expert execution
   - Partnership commitment
   - You don't do the work
   ```
